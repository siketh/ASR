msg: 

msg files are simple text files that describe the fields of a ROS message. They are used to generate source code for messages in different languages

msg files are stored in the msg directory of a package, and srv files are stored in the srv directory.

srv: 

an srv file describes a service. It is composed of two parts: a request and a response.

srv files are just like msg files, except they contain two parts: a request and a response. The two parts are separated by a '---' line.
